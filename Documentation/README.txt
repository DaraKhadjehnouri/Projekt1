I am creating a simple snake game in Python. Without any knowledge about how the logic and design should be structured I approach this project with anything but ease.

I am going to use the Gitflow methodology for version control for good practice, even if I am developing it all on my own.

At this early stage, I have a simple file structure: One folder called Development, for development, and one folder called Documentation, for documentation.
